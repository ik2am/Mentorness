Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! This repository contains the work I completed during my internship as a Data Analyst with MENTORNESS. Here, you'll find detailed analyses using SQL and Power BI on two major projects: Corona Virus Analysis and Hotel Aggregator Analysis.


Project 1: Corona Virus Analysis 

This project is designed to test SQL and data analysis skills in a real-world context. You are encouraged to be creative in your approach and to seek guidance and assistance as needed throughout the internship. 

Overview:
The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, you have been tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present your findings.


Project 2: Hotel Aggregator Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using Power BI. The dataset comprises various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create comprehensive visualizations and insights that shed light on trends, patterns, and factors influencing the performance of listings. Through Power BI, we will explore key metrics such as pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for improving the overall quality and competitiveness of the listings.
